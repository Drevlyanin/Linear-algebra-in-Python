Hello, in this repository I will leave my short summary on linear algebra in Python.

This repository contains a short summary of linear algebra concepts and examples in Python. The summary is based on the book "Linear Algebra in Python" by Devpractice Team.

The summary covers the following topics:

1.Vectors and matrices
2. Solving systems of linear equations
3. Fundamentals of Vector Algebra
4. Linear vector spaces
5. Matrix decompositions
6. Complex numbers.

NB. To work with files, do not forget to install the libraries: numpy, scipy, cmath.
