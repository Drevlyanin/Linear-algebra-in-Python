Hello, in this repository I will leave my short summary on linear algebra in Python.

This repository contains a short summary of linear algebra concepts and examples in Python. The summary is based on the book "Linear Algebra in Python" by Devpractice Team.

The summary covers the following topics:

1. Vectors and matrices
2. Solving systems of linear equations
3. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
4. Singular value decomposition
5. Least squares
6. Principal component analysis

I hope this revised README is helpful and informative! Please let me know if you have any further questions.
