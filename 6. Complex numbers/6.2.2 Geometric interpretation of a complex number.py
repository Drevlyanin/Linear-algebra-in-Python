"""
Geometrically complex number z = a + ib, can be considered as a point on
a two-dimensional plane on which a, b are coordinates. On a comprehensive
planes determine the real axis, it is denoted by Re, and the imaginary axis -
designated by Im.

Complex numbers can be represented as vectors, on the same
complex plane extending from a point with coordinates to a point (a, b).
