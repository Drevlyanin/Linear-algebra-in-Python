Natural numbers, they
are indicated by a letter N and are used to count objects. It is believed that
the smallest natural number is 1, the next is 2, etc.:
    N = {1, 2, ..., ∞}.
    
If we add and multiply natural numbers, the result will be
also natural numbers. But for subtraction this is not always feasible.

In order to be able to use the “subtraction” operation, a set
natural numbers must be expanded to the set of integers, it
denoted by Z it includes natural numbers and their negative inverses
numbers and zero:
    Z = {-∞, ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ..., ∞}.
    
Adding, subtracting and multiplying integers produces a whole number. But for the operation
“division” is not it.

Let's expand the set of numbers, this time our new set will be
contain the entire set of integers and all the fractions that can be
presented as a ratio of numerator and denominator, the latter of which is not
equal to zero. Such a set is called the set of rational numbers and
denoted by Q:
    a/b ∈ Q if a ∈ Z, b ∈ Z, b ≠ 0ю
    
In addition to simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and
division) when working with numbers, you often have to use operations: raising to
degree and root extraction. Again, if we take a suitable rational
number and take the square root of it:
    √4/9 = 2/3
we get a rational number.

By analogy with the above, you can already guess that there are such
rational numbers whose square root is not rational
number, as an example we can use the number 2:
    √2 = 1.41421356237
    
Such numbers are called irrational. Sets of rational and
irrational numbers make up the set of real numbers, it
denoted as R.

But the operation of extracting the square root is quite insidious; there are such
real numbers whose square root cannot be represented
another real number. For example, the square root of (-1) is not
real number. Before becoming familiar with complex numbers, as a rule, even
they say that such a root does not exist.

The set of complex numbers C is a set of pairs of values (a, b),
 where a is called the real part, and b is the imaginary part of the complex number.
