"""
Having the concepts of modulus and argument of a complex number, we can move on to
consideration of the trigonometric form of specifying a complex number.
If the module is denoted by r and the argument by φ, then the real and imaginary
parts of a complex number z = a + ib can be calculated like this:
    a = r · cos φ,
    b = r · sin φ.
    
The complex number itself will take the following form:
    z = r (cos φ + sin φ).
