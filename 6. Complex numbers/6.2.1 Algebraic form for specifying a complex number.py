"""
In algebraic form, a complex number is written as follows:
    z = a + ib,
where a is the real part;
b - imaginary part.
i called the imaginary unit, the square of which is equal to the unit a^2 = -1.
    âˆš-1 = i.
The zero element in the set of complex numbers is the following:
    z = 0 + i0.
