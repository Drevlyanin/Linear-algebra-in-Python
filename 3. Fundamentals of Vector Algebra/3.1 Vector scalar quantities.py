"""
If we consider a vector as an algebraic object, then it can be represented as a row or column of numbers,
those. as a matrix of size (1, n), (n, 1)^2.
Within the framework of geometric interpretation, a directed segment of a straight line rises under the vector, characterized by the length
and direction.

Scalar quantity - characterized only by a numerical value.
Vector quantity - characterized by numerical value and direction.

A vector is denoted by one small Latin letter a, or two large Latin letters AB.
α is the starting point of the vector.
AB is the end of the vector.
|α| - vector length (vector modulus).
